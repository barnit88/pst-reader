Single-Block Configuration
The single-block HN consists of a single data block with an HNHDR header structure and an 
HNPAGEMAP trailer structure at the end. The diagram in section 2.3.1.6 also shows how all the items 
allocated from the heap are located in the space between the HNHDR and the HNPAGEMAP
structures.

Data Tree Configuration
In the case of the multi-block HN, a data tree is used to fan out into multiple data blocks. An 
XXBLOCK is used if the HN exceeds the capacity of an XBLOCK, but the maximum number of blocks 
is 2 to the 16th power because of the 16-bit capacity of hidBlockIndex (section 2.3.1.1). The first 
data block is identical to the single-block case. Because the HNHDR has eight Fill Level Map slots, the 
next seven blocks only have the abbreviated HNPAGEHDR header structure. The eighth block, 
however, only has an HNBITMAPHDR header structure because a new Fill Level Map is needed. 
Because HNBITMAPHDR has 128 slots, it is only required once every 128 blocks thereafter. All the 
blocks in-between have the HNPAGEHDR header instead.
In terms of data arrangement, the data tree case is an extension to the single-block case, where 
individual heap items are allocated from the leaf data blocks in a similar manner.
